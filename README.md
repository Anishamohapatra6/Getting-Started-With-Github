## 1.	repository
<br>	A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
## 2.	repository maintainer
<br>	Someone who manages a repository. This person may also be responsible for keeping the README and contributing files updated
## 3.	README
<br>	A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. 
## 4.	license
<br>	A document that you can include with your project to let people know what they can and can't do with your source code.
## 5.	private repository
<br>	Private repositories are only visible to the repository owner and collaborators that the owner specified.
## 6.	public repository
<br>	A public repository can be viewed by anyone, including people who aren't GitHub users.
## 7.	pinned repository
<br>	A repository that a user has decided to display prominently on their profile.
## 8.	fork
<br>	A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can also open a pull request in the original repository.
## 9.	commit
<br>	A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
## 10.	commit message
<br>	Short, descriptive text that accompanies a commit and communicates the change the commit is introducing.
## 11.	pull request
<br>	Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. 
## 12.	merge
<br>	Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge). 
## 13.	pull
<br>	Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.
## 14.	clone
<br>	A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
## 15.	GitHub Pages
<br>	Also referred to as Pages. A static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.
## 16.	issue
<br>	Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. You can also categorize an issue with labels and assign it to someone.
## 17.	Markdown
<br>	Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown and uses a particular form of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown. 
## 18.	merge conflict
<br>	A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
